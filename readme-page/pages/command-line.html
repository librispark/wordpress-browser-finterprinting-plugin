									To access our WordPress page, visit viable.cs.umd.edu/wordpress/wp-login.php
									To access our general application websites, visit either:
									viable.cs.umd.edu/fingerprint_test.html
									or
									volition.cs.umd.edu/fingerprint_test.html

									These instructions involve files in the General Application: To install this on your server,
									run the install.sh (found in serverSetupScript) script on the server. backend.js and fingerprint_toolkit.js
									must be in the same folder as the script when this is run. Also, FontList.swf must be in the same directory
									as these files in order for the tool to work. Once that is complete, run the config.sh script to choose your
									server locations and such.
								</p>
								<br />
								<h2>Analysis Scripts</h2>
								<p>
									With the analysis script JS files on the same server as the MongoDB, in the same directory as backend.js, run "node scriptname.js".
								</p>
								<br />
								<h2>Control Plugin</h2>
								<p>
									To install the plugin on any browser in any OS,
									Navigate to the following url to download the plugin/extension file:
									http://crossrider.com/download/74704

									The file will be downloaded and placed in your default downloads folder. Navigate to the extensions page
									(list of your installed extensions) in your browser. Drag the file into the browser. Your browser may
									ask you for permission to install or restart the browser.

									Make sure the Goldfinger extension is listed in your extensions page, and press enable/install if necessary. You are now a control user.

									Note that this plugin simply lets us know that you are part of the control group.

									Periodically over the next seven days, open up the browser, and navigate to web page again.

									UNINSTALLATION:
									Navigate to your browser's extensions page, and click either the "x", trash can, uninstall, or disable button next to this extension (this is specific to your browser).
								</p>
								<p>
									This fingerprint is determined by a number of factors that are available by querying the browser and include
									characteristics such as browser plugins, screen size, system fonts, and other attributes. In theory, there are enough
									unique combinations of these characteristics that individual users can be distinguished from the rest using one of these
									combinations.
